# Parent Ally

This demo showcases parenting styles and educational methods.
Cards now include emoji icons and expandable sections for strengths and blind spots.
A smart search bar offers suggestions as you type and highlights matching cards.
The radar chart loads on demand and animates smoothly when a card is selected.
A mobile bottom navigation bar and floating help button improve the mobile experience.
The chart now floats on the side of the screen with a toggle to hide or show it.
It smoothly slides in and out when toggled instead of hiding on scroll.
Guided journeys now load from an external JSON file and animate as a timeline
based on the selected method. The radar chart also updates for each approach.
The interface now uses glassmorphism styling for a modern translucent look.
