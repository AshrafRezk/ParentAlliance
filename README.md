This demo showcases parenting styles and educational methods.
Cards now include emoji icons and expandable sections for strengths and blind spots.
A smart search bar offers suggestions as you type and highlights matching cards.
The radar chart loads on demand and animates smoothly when a card is selected.
A mobile bottom navigation bar and floating help button improve the mobile experience.
The chart now floats on the side of the screen with a toggle to hide or show it.
It smoothly slides in and out when toggled instead of hiding on scroll.
